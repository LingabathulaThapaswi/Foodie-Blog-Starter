Project Title: Foodie-Blog-Starter



problem statement/opportunity:

In my opinion, the Foodie Blog Starter is a simplistic design for building a blogging website that makes a professional-looking blog view for food bloggers. The Food Blogging Website is fully suitable for food blogging with its enhanced design to attract more traffic.



Project Description:

I have created a Foodie Blog website named Foodie Blog Starter using HTML, CSS, and JS. It helps to attract more traffic for food lovers. I created three pages on this website: "home," "about," and "contact."On the Foodie Blog Home Page, I included the Foodie Blog Banner, Blogs Categories, Videos for Tutorials, Newsletter, and Contact Page, which made the overall look like a professional website. I am trying to solve the real world problem by deploying this website by using the Azure static webapp through github workflow actions to show the clear working website to the world to help the food likers with these food blogs to make their healthy and tasty lives simpler.
